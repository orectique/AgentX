# Scrub

A chrome extension to manage browser history straight from the toolbar.

### Usage

As I have absolutely no interest in bending to the corporate claw of Google, this extension will not be published on the Web Store. However, feel free to clone the repository to your computer and load the unpacked extension to your browser. 
**Note**: You might have to enable Developer mode for this.
